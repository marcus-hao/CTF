We're given a QR code that's different from usual.

This is an rMQR (rectangular two-dimensional barcode), and was referenced in a John Hammond video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8S-NJ1GTn4).

To solve this challenge, I used QRQR from playstore to scan the QR code and got the flag.

Flag: `flag{a44557e380e3baae9c21c738664c6142}`
